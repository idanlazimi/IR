#Getting Better
#J. Lennon, P. McCartney

It's getting better all the time. ( Better, better, better )
I used to get mad at my school,
The teachers who taught me weren't cool.
Holding me down,
Turning me round,
Filling me up with your rules.

I've got to admit it's getting better,
It's a little better all the time.
I have to admit it's getting better,
It's getting better since you've been mine.

Me used to be angry young man,
Me hiding me head in the sand.
You gave me the word,
I finally heard,
I'm doing the best that I can.

I've got to admit it's getting better,
It's a little better all the time.
I have to admit it's getting better,
It's getting better since you've been mine,
Getting so much better all the time.
It's getting better all the time, ( Better, better, better )
It's getting better all the time. ( Better, better, better )

I used to be cruel to my woman,
I beat her, and kept her apart from the things that she loved.
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene,
And I'm doing the best that I can.

I've got to admit it's getting better,
It's a little better all the time.
I have to admit it's getting better,
It's getting better since you've been mine.
Getting so much better all the time.
It's getting better all the time, ( Better, better, better )
It's getting better all the time. ( Better, better, better )
Getting so much better all the time.
