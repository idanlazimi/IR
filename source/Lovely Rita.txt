#Lovely Rita
#J. Lennon, P. McCartney

Lovely Rita, Meter Maid,
Lovely Rita, Meter Maid,
Lovely Rita, Meter Maid,
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parki? meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticked in her little white book,
In a car she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder,
Made her look a little like a milit'ry man.

Lovely Rita, Meter Maid,
May I enquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me?

Lovely Rita, Meter Maid,
Lovely Rita, Meter Maid.
