#Fixing A Hole
#J. Lennon, P. McCartney

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go.
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go.

And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door.

I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering,
There I will go.

And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door.

I taking a time for a number of things
That went important yesterday,
And I still come.
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go.
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go.
