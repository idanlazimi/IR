#A Day In The Life
#J. Lennon, P. McCartney

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade.
And though the news was rather sad,
I just had to laugh,
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car.
He didn't notice that the lights had changed.
A crowd of people stood and stared,
They'd seen his face before.
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today, oh boy.
The English army had just won the war.
A crowd of people turned away,
But I just had to look.
Having read the book,
I'd love to turn you on.

Woke up, got out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head.
Found my way downstairs and drunk a cup
And looking up I notice I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat,
Made the bus in second flat.
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream.
