But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.

Sgt. Pepper's lonely hearts club band.

We're sgt. Pepper's lonely hearts club band,
We hope you will enjoy the show.

Sit back and let the evening go.
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, sgt. Pepper's lonely,

It's certainly a thrill,
You're such a lovely audience,
We'd like to take you home with us,
We'd love to take you home.

But I thought that you might like to know
That the singers going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing alone.
