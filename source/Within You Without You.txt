#Within You Without You	
#G. Harrison

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion,
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away.

We were talking about the love we all could share,
When we find it to try our best to hold it there
With our love, with our love we could save the world.

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change.
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you.

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see. Are you one of them?
