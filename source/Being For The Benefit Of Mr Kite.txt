#Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite
#J. Lennon, P. McCartney

For the benefit of mr. Kite there will be a show tonight
on trampoline.
The Hendersons will all be there late of Pablo Fanques fair,
what a scene;
Over men and horses hoops and garters lastly through a hogs head
of real fire.
In this way mr. K. will challenge the world.

The celebrated mr. K. performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate.
The Hendersons will dance and sing as mr. K. flies through the ring
don't be late.
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public their production will be
second to none.
And of course Henry the horse dances the waltz.

The band begin at ten to six when mr. K. performs his tricks
without a sound.
And mr. H. will demonstrate ten somersets he'll undertake
on solid ground.
Having been some days in preparation a splendid time
is guaranteed for all.
And tonight mr. Kite is topping the bill.
