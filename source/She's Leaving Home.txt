#She's Leaving Home
#J. Lennon, P. McCartney

Wedn'sday morning at five o'clock as the day begins,
Silently closing her bedroom door,
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more.
She goes down stairs to the kitchen clutching her hand kerchief.
Quetly turning the back door key,
Stepping outside she is free.

She ( We gave her most of our lives )
Is leaving ( Sacrificed most of our lives )
Home ( We gave her ev'rything money could buy )
She's leaving home after living alone for so many years.

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing down.
Pick up the letter that's lying there,
Standing alone at the top of the stairs.
She breaks down and cries to her husband "Daddy, our baby's gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly,
Now could she do this to me."

She ( We never thought of ourselves )
Is leaving ( Never a thought of ourselves )
Home ( We struggled hard all our lives to get by )
She's leaving home after living alone for so many years.

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away.
Waiting to keep the appointment she made,
Meeting a man from the motor trade.

She ( What did we do that was wrong )
Is having ( We didn't know it was wrong )
Fun ( Fun is the one thing that money can't buy )
Something inside that was always denied for so many years.
She's leaving home, bye, bye.
